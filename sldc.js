// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration


let stepOne = "Planning";
let stepTwo = "Analysis of Requirements";
let stepThree = "Design";
let stepFour = "Implementation";
let stepFive = "Testing & Integration";
let stepSix  = "Maintain";

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "Determine what the application is supposed to do and its requirements. Define resources needed to build project."
const design = "Models the way a software application will work. Aspects of design include architecture, user interface, platforms, programming, communications, and security."
const implementation = "Actual writing of the program."
const testingAndIntegration = "Test the application before making it available to users. Testing ensures the function works correctly. Testing reduces number of bugs and glitches users may encounter. Essentially this ensures that the developed systems meet all the technical requirements with the components and subsystems integrated. The system test may require any number of additional tests depending on the scope and complexity of the requirements; examples include: security,  conformance, accessibility, performance, stress, compatibility, and  regression tests."
const maintain = "Last step. Application is done and in the field. Users discover bugs that weren't found during testing. So this fixes extra bugs but this is also a time to plan additional features in future release."
